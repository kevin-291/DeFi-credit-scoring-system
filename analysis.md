## Recommendations

### For Lending Protocols

2. **Early Warning Systems**: Monitor declining credit scores
3. **Incentive Programs**: Reward good repayment behavior
4. **Bot Detection**: Implement automated bot identification

### For Risk Management
1. **Tiered Interest Rates**: Lower rates for high-scoring wallets
2. **Collateral Requirements**: Reduce for excellent credit scores
3. **Monitoring Frequency**: Increase for high-risk wallets
4. **Liquidation Thresholds**: Adjust based on historical behavior

### For Users
1. **Credit Building**: Maintain good repayment ratios
2. **Diversification**: Use multiple assets and protocols
3. **Consistency**: Regular, predictable transaction patterns
4. **Risk Management**: Monitor collateral ratios actively

## Conclusion

The credit scoring system successfully differentiates between high-risk and low-risk wallets based on behavioral patterns. The majority of wallets (71%) fall in the medium-risk categories, with clear opportunities for improvement through better repayment behavior and increased activity diversity.

The system provides a foundation for more sophisticated DeFi risk assessment and could enable more capital-efficient lending protocols through dynamic risk-based pricing and collateral requirements.
